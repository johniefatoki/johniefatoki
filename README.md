- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm John, a passionate Data Scientist, HR Professional and Chartered Accountant based in the UK.
- ðŸ‘€ Here, you'll find a collection of projects, contributions, and collaborations that reflect my interests and expertise in Machine Learning and Data Science
- ðŸŒ± My innovative capabilities as a data scientist emerged in June 2017, when I was appointed as payroll consultant at Africaâ€™s largest financial institution, where I invented a wage code (5G15) that mitigated the tax inaccuracies on the SAP Payroll system. 
      Furthermore, I have been instrumental in automating Standard Bank's digital HR initiatives (Auto Transfers, Customer Submissions Portal and the TED chat bot project) and slashed turnaround time for payroll remittances by 3 working days through digitization.
      Since then, I have been on a constant quest to learn and grow, and GitHub has been a part of this journey.
